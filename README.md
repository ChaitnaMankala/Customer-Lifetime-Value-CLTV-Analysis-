# Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Analysis
This project analyzes customer acquisition, revenue, conversion efficiency, and customer lifetime value (CLTV) across different marketing channels. The goal is to help businesses make data-driven decisions regarding acquisition strategies, marketing investments, and customer retention.

**Project Overview**
Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) analysis helps estimate the total worth of a customer to a business over the entire duration of their relationship. This project explores:
- Acquisition cost distribution
- Revenue distribution
- Channel-wise conversion efficiency
- ROI (Return on Investment) by channel
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)
- Comparative performance of key acquisition channels

**Dataset**
The dataset includes the following fields:
- customer_id: Unique identifier for each customer
- channel: Customer acquisition channel (e.g., social media, email marketing, referral)
- cost: Cost incurred to acquire the customer
- conversion_rate: Probability of conversion through the respective channel
- revenue: Revenue generated by the customer

**Key Analyses Performed**

**- Distribution Analysis**
Histograms for acquisition cost and revenue

**- Channel-Wise Breakdown**
  - Average acquisition cost by channel
  - Average conversion rate by channel
  - Total revenue by channel (donut chart)

**- ROI Calculation**
ROI = Revenue / Cost

**- CLTV Calculation**
CLTV = (Revenue â€“ Cost) * Conversion Rate / Cost

**- CLTV Distribution Comparison**

**Insights**
 - Email marketing has the highest ROI despite its low acquisition cost
 - Social media drives the highest conversion rate
 - CLTV is maximized through referral and social media channels
 - Paid advertising is the most expensive and least effective channel overall

**Future Scope**
 - Incorporate time-based retention modeling
 - Extend CLTV model with customer segmentation
 - Use machine learning to predict high-CLTV customers
